Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::TextIndex.
0.05 Added unscored_search() which returns a reference to an array of
     document_ids, without scores.  Should be much faster than scored search.

     Added error handling in case _occurence() doesn't return a number.

0.04 Bug fix: add_document() will return if passed empty array ref
     instead of producing error.

     Changed _boolean_compare() and _phrase_search() so and_words and
     phrases behave better in multiple-field searches. Result set for each
     field is calculated first, then union of all fields is taken for
     final result set.

     Scores are scaled lower in _search().

0.03 Added example scripts in examples/.

0.02 Added or_mask_set.

0.01 Initial public release. Should be considered beta, and methods may
     be added or changed until the first stable release.
