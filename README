NAME
    DBIx::TextIndex - Perl extension for full-text searching in SQL
    databases

SYNOPSIS
    use DBIx::TextIndex;

    my $index = DBIx::TextIndex->new({ document_dbh => $document_dbh,
    document_table => 'document_table', document_fields => ['column_1',
    'column_2'], document_id_field => 'primary_key', index_dbh =>
    $index_dbh, collection => 'collection_1', });

    $index->initialize;

    $index->add_document(\@document_ids);

    my $results = $index->search({ column_1 => '"a phrase" +and -not or',
    column_2 => 'more words', });

    foreach my $document_id (sort {$$results{$b} <=> $$results{$a}} keys
    %$results ) { print "DocumentID: $document_id Score:
    $$results{$document_id} \n"; }

    $index->delete;

DESCRIPTION
    DBIx::TextIndex was developed for doing full-text searches on BLOB
    columns stored in a MySQL database. Almost any database with BLOB and
    DBI support should work with minor adjustments to SQL statements in the
    module.

    Implements a crude parser for tokenizing a user input string into
    phrases, can-include words, must-include words, and must-not-include
    words.

    The following methods are available:

  $index = DBIx::TextIndex->new(\%args)

    Constructor method. The first time an index is created, the following
    arguments must be passed to new():

    my $index = DBIx::TextIndex->new({ document_dbh => $document_dbh,
    document_table => 'document_table', document_fields => ['column_1',
    'column_2'], document_id_field => 'primary_key', index_dbh =>
    $index_dbh, collection => 'collection_1', });

    document_dbh
        DBI connection handle to database containing text documents

    document_table
        Name of database table containing text documents

    document_fields
        Reference to a list of column names to be indexed from
        document_table

    document_id_field
        Name of a unique integer key column in document_table

    index_dbh
        DBI connection handle to database containing TextIndex tables. I
        recommend using a separate database for your TextIndex, because the
        module creates and drops tables without warning.

    collection
        A name for the index. Should contain only alpha-numeric characters
        or underscores [A-Za-z0-9_]

    After creating a new TextIndex for the first time, and after calling
    initialize(), only the index_dbh, document_dbh, and collection arguments
    are needed to create subsequent instances of a TextIndex.

  $index->initialize

    This method creates all the inverted tables for the TextIndex in the
    database specified by document_dbh. This method should be called only
    once when creating a new index! It drops all the inverted tables before
    creating new ones.

    initialize() also stores the document_table, document_fields, and
    document_id_field attributes in a special table called "collection," so
    subsequent calls to new() for a given collection do not need those
    arguments.

  $index->add_document(\@document_ids)

    Add all the @documents_ids from document_id_field to the TextIndex.
    @document_ids must be sorted from lowest to highest. All further calls
    to add_document() must use @document_ids higher than those previously
    added to the index. Reindexing previously-indexed documents will yield
    unpredictable results!

  $index->search(\%search_args)

    search() returns $results, a reference to a hash. The values of the hash
    are document ids, keyed by the relative score of the document. If an
    error occured while searching, $results will be a scalar variable
    containing an error message.

    $results = $index->search({ first_field => '+andword -notword orword
    "phrase words"', second_field => ... ... });

    if (ref $results) { print "The score for $document_id is $results-
    >{$document_id}\n"; } else { print "Error: $results\n"; }

  $index->delete

    delete() removes the tables associated with a TextIndex from index_dbh.

CHANGES
    0.03 Added example scripts in examples/.

    0.02 Added or_mask_sets.

    0.01 Initial public release. Should be considered beta, and methods may
    be added or changed until the first stable release.

    Thanks to Ulrich Pfeifer for ideas and code from Man::Index module in
    "Information Retrieval, and What pack 'w' Is For" article from The Perl

    Thanks to Steffen Beyer for the Bit::Vector module, which enables fast
    set operations in this module. Version 5.3 or greater of Bit::Vector is

BUGS
    Uses too much memory.

    MySQL-specific SQL is used.

    Parser is not very good.

    Documentation is not complete.

    Phrase searching relies on full-table scan. Any suggestions for adding
    word-proximity information to the index would be much appreciated.

    No facility for deleting documents from an index. Work-around: create a
    new index.
