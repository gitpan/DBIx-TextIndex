DESCRIPTION
    DBIx::TextIndex was developed for doing full-text searches on BLOB
    columns stored in a database. Almost any database with BLOB and DBI
    support should work with minor adjustments to SQL statements in the
    module.

    Implements a crude parser for tokenizing a user input string into
    phrases, can-include words, must-include words, and must-not-include
    words.

    Operates in case insensitive manner.

    The following methods are available:

  $index = DBIx::TextIndex->new(\%args)
    Constructor method. The first time an index is created, the following
    arguments must be passed to new():

     my $index = DBIx::TextIndex->new({
         doc_dbh => $doc_dbh,
         doc_table => 'doc_table',
         doc_fields => ['column_1', 'column_2'],
         doc_id_field => 'primary_key',
         index_dbh => $index_dbh,
         collection => 'collection_1'
     });

    Other arguments are optional.

    doc_dbh
        DBI connection handle to database containing text documents

    doc_table
        Name of database table containing text documents

    doc_fields
        Reference to a list of column names to be indexed from doc_table

    doc_id_field
        Name of a unique integer key column in doc_table

    index_dbh
        DBI connection handle to database containing TextIndex tables. Using
        a separate database for your TextIndex is recommended, because the
        module creates and drops tables without warning.

    collection
        A name for the index. Should contain only alpha-numeric characters
        or underscores [A-Za-z0-9_]

    proximity_index
        Activates a proximity index for faster phrase searches and word
        proximity based matching. Disabled by default. Only efficient for
        bigger documents. Takes up a lot of space and slows down the
        indexing process. Proximity based matching is activated by a query
        containing a phrase in form of:

                ":2 some phrase" => matches "some nice phrase"
                ":1 some phrase" => matches only exact "some phrase"
                ":10 some phrase" => matches "some [1..9 words] phrase"

                Defaults to ":1" when omitted.

        The proximity matches work only forwards, not backwards, that means:

                ":3 some phrase" does not match "phrase nice some" or "phrase some"

    db  SQL used in this module is database specific in some aspects. In
        order to use this module with a variety of databases, so called
        "database module" can be specified. Default is the mysql module.
        Another modules have yet to be written.

        Names of the database modules correspond to the names of DBI drivers
        and are case sensitive.

    errors
        This hash reference can be used to override default error messages.
        Please refer to the SYNOPSIS for meaning of the particular keys and
        values.

    charset Default is 'iso-8859-1'.
        Accented characters are converted to ASCII equivalents based on the
        charset.

        Pass 'iso-8859-2' for Czech or other Slavic languages.

    stoplist
        Activates stoplisting of very common words that are present in
        almost every document. Default is not to use stoplisting. Value of
        the parameter is a reference to array of two-letter language codes
        in lower case. Currently only two stoplists exist:

                en => English
                cz => Czech

    max_word_length
        Specifies maximum word length resolution. Defaults to 20 characters.

    result_threshold
        Defaults to 5000 documents.

    phrase_threshold
        Defaults to 1000 documents.

    decode_html_entities
        Decode html entities before indexing documents (e.g. &amp; -> &).
        Default is 1.

    print_activity
        Activates STDOUT debugging. Higher value increases verbosity.

    After creating a new TextIndex for the first time, and after calling
    initialize(), only the index_dbh, doc_dbh, and collection arguments are
    needed to create subsequent instances of a TextIndex.

  $index->initialize
    This method creates all the inverted tables for the TextIndex in the
    database specified by doc_dbh. This method should be called only once
    when creating a new index! It drops all the inverted tables before
    creating new ones.

    initialize() also stores the doc_table, doc_fields, doc_id_field,
    language, stoplist, error attributes, proximity_index, max_word_length,
    result_threshold, phrase_threshold and min_wildcard_length preferences
    in a special table called "collection," so subsequent calls to new() for
    a given collection do not need those arguments.

    Calling initialize() will upgrade the collection table created by
    earlier versions of DBIx::TextIndex if necessary.

  $index->upgrade_collection_table
    Upgrades the collection table to the latest format. Usually does not
    need to be called by the programmer, because initialize() handles
    upgrades automatically.

  $index->add_doc(\@doc_ids)
    Add all the @docs_ids from doc_id_field to the TextIndex. All further
    calls to add_doc() must use @doc_ids higher than those previously added
    to the index. Reindexing previously-indexed documents will yield
    unpredictable results!

  $index->remove_doc(\@doc_ids)
    This method accepts a reference to an array of doc ids as its parameter.
    The specified documents will be removed from the index, but not from the
    actual documents table that is being indexed. The documents itself must
    be accessible when you remove them from the index. The ids should be
    sorted from lowest to highest.

    It's actually not possible to completely recover the space taken by the
    documents that are removed, therefore it's recommended to rebuild the
    index when you remove a significant amount of documents.

    All space reserved in the proximity index is recovered. Approx. 75% of
    space reserved in the inverted tables and max term frequency table is
    recovered.

  $index->disable_doc(\@doc_ids)
    This method can be used to disable documents. Disabled documents are not
    included in search results. This method should be used to "remove"
    documents from the index. Disabled documents are not actually removed
    from the index, therefore its size will remain the same. It's
    recommended to rebuild the index when you disable a significant amount
    of documents.

  $index->search(\%search_args)
    search() returns $results, a hash reference. The keys of the hash are
    doc ids, and the values are the relative scores of the documents. If an
    error occured while searching, search will throw a
    DBIx::TextIndex::Exception::Query object.

     eval {
         $results = $index->search({
             first_field => '+andword -notword orword "phrase words"',
             second_field => ...
             ...
         });
     };
     if ($@) {
         if ($@->isa('DBIx::TextIndex::Exception::Query') {
             print "No results: " . $@->error . "\n";
         } else {
             # Something more drastic happened
             $@->rethrow;
         }
     } else {
         print "The score for $doc_id is $results->{$doc_id}\n";
     }

  $index->unscored_search(\%search_args)
    unscored_search() returns $doc_ids, a reference to an array. Since the
    scoring algorithm is skipped, this method is much faster than search().
    A DBIx::TextIndex::Exception::Query object will be thrown if the query
    is bad or no results are found.

     eval {
         $doc_ids = $index->unscored_search({
             first_field => '+andword -notword orword "phrase words"',
             second_field => ...
         });
     };
     if ($@) {
         if ($@->isa('DBIx::TextIndex::Exception::Query') {
             print "No results: " . $@->error . "\n";
         } else {
             # Something more drastic happened
             $@->rethrow;
         }
     } else {
         print "Here's all the doc ids:\n";
         map { print "$_\n" } @$doc_ids;
     }

  @doc_ids = $index->all_docs_ids
    all_doc_ids() return a list of all doc_ids currently in the index.

  $index->stat
    Allows you to obtain some meta information about the index. Accepts one
    parameter that specifies what you want to obtain.

            $index->stat('total_words')

    Returns a total count of words in the index. This number may differ from
    the total count of words in the documents itself.

  $index->delete
    delete() removes the tables associated with a TextIndex from index_dbh.

SUPPORT FOR SEARCH MASKS
    DBIx::TextIndex can apply boolean operations on arbitrary lists of doc
    ids to search results.

    Take this table:

     doc_id  category  doc_full_text
     1       green     full text here ...
     2       green     ...
     3       blue      ...
     4       red       ...
     5       blue      ...
     6       green     ...

    Masks that represent doc ids for in each the three categories can be
    created:

  $index->add_mask($mask_name, \@doc_ids);
     $index->add_mask('green_category', [ 1, 2, 6 ]);
     $index->add_mask('blue_category', [ 3, 5 ]);
     $index->add_mask('red_category', [ 4 ]);

    The first argument is an arbitrary string, and the second is a reference
    to any array of doc ids that the mask name identifies.

    mask operations are passed in a second argument hash reference to
    $index->search():

     %query_args = (
         first_field => '+andword -notword orword "phrase words"',
         second_field => ...
         ...
     );

     %args = (
         not_mask => \@not_mask_list,
         and_mask => \@and_mask_list,
         or_mask  => \@or_mask_list,
         or_mask_set => [ \@or_mask_list_1, \@or_mask_list_2, ... ],
     );

    $index->search(\%query_args, \%args);

    not_mask
        For each mask in the not_mask list, the intersection of the search
        query results and all documents not in the mask is calculated.

        From our example above, to narrow search results to documents not in
        green category:

         $index->search(\%query_args, { not_mask => ['green_category'] });

    and_mask
        For each mask in the and_mask list, the intersection of the search
        query results and all documents in the mask is calculated.

        This would give return results only in blue category:

         $index->search(\%query_args,
                        { and_mask => ['blue_category'] });

        Instead of using named masks, lists of doc ids can be passed on the
        fly as array references. This would give the same results as the
        previous example:

         my @blue_ids = (3, 5);
         $index->search(\%query_args,
                        { and_mask => [ \@blue_ids ] });

    or_mask_set
        With the or_mask_set argument, the union of all the masks in each
        list is computed individually, and then the intersection of each
        union set with the query results is calculated.

    or_mask
        An or_mask is treated as an or_mask_set with only one list. In this
        example, the union of blue_category and red_category is taken, and
        then the intersection of that union with the query results is
        calculated:

         $index->search(\%query_args,
                        { or_mask => [ 'blue_category', 'red_category' ] });

  $index->delete_mask($mask_name);
        Deletes a single mask from the mask table in the database.

PARTIAL PATTERN MATCHING USING WILDCARDS
        You can use wildcard characters "%" or "*" at end of a word to match
        all words that begin with that word. Example:

            the "%" character means "match any characters"

            car%        ==> matches "car", "cars", "careful", "cartel", ....

            the "*" character means "match also the plural form"

            car*        ==> matches only "car" or "cars"

        The option min_wildcard_length is used to set the minimum length of
        word base appearing before the "%" wildcard character. Defaults to
        five characters to avoid selection of excessive amounts of word
        combinations. Unless this option is set to a lower value, the examle
        above (car%) wouldn't produce any results.

HIGHLIGHTING OF QUERY WORDS OR PATTERNS IN RESULTING DOCUMENTS
        A module HTML::Highlight can be used either independently or
        together with DBIx::TextIndex for this task.

        The HTML::Highlight module provides a very nice Google-like
        highligting using different colors for different words or phrases
        and also can be used to preview a context in which the query words
        appear in resulting documents.

        The module works together with DBIx::TextIndex using its new method
        html_highlight().

        Check example script 'html_search.cgi' in the 'examples/' directory
        of DBIx::TextIndex distribution or refer to the documentation of
        HTML::Highlight for more information.

CZECH LANGUAGE SUPPORT
        For czech diacritics insensitive operation you need to set the
        language option to 'cz'.

                my $index = DBIx::TextIndex->new({
                        ....
                        language => 'cz',
                        ....
                });

        This option MUST be set for correct czech language proccessing.
        Diacritics sensitive operation is not possible.

        Requires the module "CzFast" that is available on CPAN in directory
        of author "TRIPIE".

Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::TextIndex.

=head1 CHANGES

0.14
    Fixed memory leak in integer decoding

0.13
    Changed format for inverted list postings to compressed binary
    format.  Index sizes should be 50% smaller than with previous versions.
    Implemented XS code for fast coding and decoding.

    Renamed 'freq_d' to 'docfreq_t'.

    Bug fix: add_doc will only set bits in all_docs_vector if document
    was actually added

    UPGRADE warning, indexes will have to be rebuilt.

0.12
    Added _optimize_or_search(). If query contains just OR words,
    turn the rarest words into AND words to reduce result set size
    before scoring.  Practically, this makes queries behave more like
    "all of the words" instead of "any of the words," which seems to
    be what the average user expects.

    Changed all symbols 'occurence' to 'freq_d' (frequency of docs in
    entire collection that contain term)

    Multi-field queries will return the intersection of all fields
    instead of the union.

    Added method all_doc_ids().

    There is no longer any need to sort doc_ids before passing
    to add_doc().

    Added more tests. WARNING: MySQL database 'test' must be available
    on localhost for tests to succeed.

    UPGRADE WARNING: collection table format changed, new index table
    collection_all_docs_vector added, some field names have changed in
    inverted tables.  Any indexes created with 0.11 or earlier will have
    to be deleted and recreated.

    UPGRADE WARNING: all symbols with "document" have been renamed to
    "doc" for brevity.  Methods have also been renamed, e.g. add_document()
    is now add_doc().  The old method names will work, but are deprecated.

    Replaced option 'language' with 'charset'.  iso-8859-1 is the
    default charset.

    Added call to Text::Unaccent::unac_string (www.senga.org) to replace
    accented characters with plain ASCII equivalent.  Uses 'charset' option
    to determine mapping.
   
    UPGRADE WARNING: added structured exceptions using Exception::Class.
    Calls to search() now have to be wrapped with eval blocks to catch
    query exceptions.

0.11

    Bug fix: HTML tags are now changed to a single space, instead of
    empty string when indexing document. Prevents concatenation of words
    in some cases.

0.10

    Fixed collection table upgrade bug

0.09 

    Changed $MAX_WORD_LENGTH default to 20

    Allow numbers to be indexed as words

    Use HTML::Entities to decode entities in indexed documents, on by default. Set option decode_html_entities to 0 to disable.

    Use $dbh->tables to check for existence of tables (caution, may not
    work in DBI > 1.30).

0.08 

    Bug fix: add_mask() was not inserting masks

0.07

    UPGRADE WARNING: collection table format changed, use new method
    $index->upgrade_collection_table() to recreate collection table. 
    Calling initialize() method for a new collection will also upgrade
    collection table. Index backup recommended.

    Added error_ prefix to error message column names in collection table

    Added version column to collection table

    Added language column to collection table, removed czech_language column

    UPGRADE WARNING: instead of new({ czech_language => 1}), use
    new({ language => 'cz' })

    Bug fix: _store_collection_info() error if stop lists are not used

    unscored_search() will now return a scalar error message
    if an error occurs in search

    search() will croak if passed an invalid field name to search on

    Added documentation for mask operations

0.06 

    tripie's patch v2 updates:

    - a bug in document removing proccess related to incorrect
    'occurency' data updates when multi-field documents were removed,
    was fixed.  The methods remove_document() and _inverted_remove()
    were affected.

    - a bug related to wildcards in queries in form of "+word +next%"
    or "+word% +next%" was fixed

    - a bug related to "%" wildcards used while searching of
    multi-field documents was fixed

    - a bug related to stoplists and phrases that contain a
    non-stoplisted word together with a stoplisted word was fixed

    - a new full-featured solution of highligting of query words or
    patterns in content of resulting documents was added

    I've written a new module HTML::Highlight, that can be used
    either independently or together with DBIx::TextIndex. Its
    advantages include:

      - it makes highlighting very easy
      - takes phrases and wildcards into account
      - supports diacritics insensitive highlighting for iso-8859-2
        languages
      - takes HTML tags into account. That means when a user searches
        for for example 'font', than a FONT element in <FONT COLOR="red">
        does not get "highlighted".
		
    The module provides a very nice Google-like highlighting using
    different colors for different words or phrases.

    The module works together with DBIx::TextIndex using its new method
    html_highlight().

    The module can also be used to preview a context in which query
    words appear in resulting documents.
		
    - the old method highlight() was not changed nor removed for sake of
    compatibility with old code
	
    - I put a new 'html_search.cgi' script to examples/ to show how the new
    highligting and context previewing works.
	  
    - the HTML::Highlight module can be found on CPAN - 
    http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/T/TR/TRIPIE/

    - the new highlighting solution has been documented in a new section
    of the documentation
	  
  tripie v1 changes:

    added proximity indexing
      - based on positions of words in a document
      - by default it is disabled, activate it by new option "proximity_index"
      - very efficient for bigger documents, much worse for small ones
      - it's very big (approx. 20 bytes for each word)
      - allows fast proximity based searches in form of:
        ":2 some phrase" => matches "some nice phrase"
        ":1 some phrase" => matches only exact "some phrase"
        ":10 some phrase" => matches "some [1..9 words] phrase"
        defaults to ":1" when omitted
      - the proximity matches work only forwards, not backwards,
        that means:
        ":3 some phrase" does not match "phrase nice some" or "phrase some"

    rewrote the word splitter and query parser
      - added support for czech language diacritics insensitive indexing
        and searching (option "czech_language")
	(note: changed option to "charset", pass value "iso-8859-2"
	to enable -dkoch)
        that is implemented by converting both the indexed data and
	the query from iso-8859-2 to ASCII

      - this can also be used for other iso-8859-2 based Slavic languages

      - the above is performed by my module "CzFast" that can
        be found on CPAN (my CPAN id is "TRIPIE"), and is optional

    added partial pattern matching using wildcards "%" or "*"
      - these wildcards can be used at end of a word to match all words
        that begin with that word, ie.

        the "%" character means "match any characters"

        car%	==> matches "car", "cars", "careful", "cartel", ....

        the "*" character means "match also the plural form"

        car*	==> matches only "car" or "cars"

      - added option "min_wildcard_length" to specify minimal length of a
        word base appearing before the "%" wildcard character to avoid
        selection of excessive amount of results

    added a database abstraction layer - all SQL queries were moved to
    separate module (see lib/ and the docs for new "db" option) and
    polished a bit for better maintainability and possible support of
    other SQL dialects

    added stoplists
      - some words that are too common (are present in almost every document)
	are not indexed and are removed from the search query before processing
	to avoid expensive processing of excessively huge result sets
      - user is notified when a search does not produce any results because
	some words he used in his query were stoplisted (no_results_stop)
      - stoplists can be easily localized or modified 
      - default is not to use any stoplist, one or more stoplists 
	can be selected using the "stoplist" option
      - stoplist data files are in lib/
      - english (en) and czech (cz) stoplists are included
      - more than one stoplist can be used

    added a facility to remove documents from the index - 
      check the documentation for new method "remove_document" for more info.
	
      There is no way to recover all the space taken by the documents that are
      being removed. This method manages to recover approx. 80% of the space.
	
      It's recommended to rebuild the index when you remove a
      significant amount of documents.

    added a facility to obtain some statistical information about the index -
      check the documentation for new method "stat"

    max_word_length, phrase_threshold and result_threshold are now configurable
    options

    added configuration options to customize/localize the error messages
    (no_results etc.)

    all new configuration options are properly stored in collection's data

    max_word_length limit now works much better - all words are stripped
    down to the maximum size before they are stored to the index,
    and also all query words are stripped down to the maximum word
    size before they are proccessed. Now when the max word length
    is set to, say, six and a user searches for for example
    "consciousness", all documents containing any words beginning
    with "consci" are returned Therefore the new max_word_length
    option is not a limit of a word size, but rather a
    "resolution" preference.  added some comments and occasionally
    corrected indentation

    documented the enhancements

    bugfix: when RaiseError was set on a DBI connection, then one
    query which only switched off PrintError to avoid some problems, failed

    note: the interface was not changed - old code using this module should
    run without any changes

    Thanks for this excellent module and please excuse my inferior English !

0.05

    Added unscored_search() which returns a reference to an array of
doc_ids, without scores.  Should be much faster than scored search.

    Added error handling in case _occurence() doesn't return a number.

0.04

    Bug fix: add_document() will return if passed empty array ref instead
of producing error.

    Changed _boolean_compare() and _phrase_search() so and_words and
phrases behave better in multiple-field searches. Result set for each
field is calculated first, then union of all fields is taken for
final result set.

    Scores are scaled lower in _search().

0.03

    Added example scripts in examples/.

0.02

    Added or_mask_set.

0.01

    Initial public release.  Should be considered beta, and methods may be
added or changed until the first stable release.
